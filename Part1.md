#Title: 
ProjectPlatypus

#Description: 
A student-centered web application that matches users with classmates for projects, study groups, and extracurricular activities. The application will use a unique matching algorithm based on courseload, scheduling, and mutual interest to match students with potential partners.

#Vision statement: 
Managing students based on academic need and extracurricular interest as the preferred social media platform of academia. 

#Motivation: 
To give students a better way to connect with each other for group projects and study sessions, alleviating the logistical hurdles that come with finding potential student collaborators. In consolidating diverse backgrounds and skillsets, we can bring together the most outstanding qualities of each member to create a cohesive amalgamation from disparate parts - much like the venerable platypus.

#Risks: 
The risks associated with the project include:
  * a general lack of experience with web coding and web-based applications
  * working cross-platform due to differences in operating systems and computer architecture among group members 
  * limited time for in-person group meetings. 

Our efforts to mitigate these issues include:  
  * a continuous feedback loop of communication through social media
  * storing all files in the Github group repository 
  * pair programming to avoid operating system conflict
  * educating all members of the group about web application development through self-directed and partner-guided learning

#VCS: 
We will use GitHub as our version control system.
