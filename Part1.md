#Title: 
ProjectPlatypus

#Description: 
A basic web application where users can select what classes they are in at CU and be matched to other classmates for projects. The application will take basic data and use a matching algorithm in order to match students with potential partners. 

#Vision statement: 
Managing students based on academic need and extracurricular interest, as the preferred social media platform of academia. 

#Motivation: 
To give students a better way to connect with each other for group projects, helping to alleviate some of the stress that comes with finding a group for a project. We can bring together peoples best qualities to create something amazing, like a platypus. 

#Risks: 
There are many risks associated with the project, including a general lack of experience with web coding and web based applications, working cross platform because of differences in operating systems between group members, and limited time for in person group meetings. Our efforts to mitigate these important issues include a continuous feedback loop of communication through social media, storing all files in the Github group repository, pair programming to avoid operating system conflict, and self educating all members of the group about developing a web application. 

#VCS: 
The team plans to use GitHub as the version control system.
